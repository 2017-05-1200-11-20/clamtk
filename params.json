It is designed to be an easy-to-use, lightweight, on-demand antivirus scanner for Linux systems. February 2016 marks our twelfth year!\r\n\r\nFrom this page, you can download Fedora and CentOS rpms as well as Debian and Ubuntu debs. There are builds for older distributions such as Ubuntu 12.04 and CentOS 6.
